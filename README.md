# SkyblockFlipper
A Hypixel Skyblock mod to notify the user of valuable flips or specific items listed to the Auction House

# Setup Guide
> Download the latest mod release

> Put it into your .minecraft/mods folder

> Launch your game and join Hypixel Skyblock

> Use '/api new' to automatically configure your api key (if that does not work, use /sbf apikey [key]

> Run /sbf to see all available configuration commands, or edit the config at .minecraft/config/skyblockflipper

> Click the text to open the auction house

**not all prices will be 100% correct, be sure you know the true price of things before buying as they could be subject to market manipulation. A good way of checking this could be using a mod like NEU, as they have a better calculator.**
